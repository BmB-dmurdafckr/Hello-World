# Hello-World
Fulfilling unfulfilled dreams(Just another repository)
My name is Marcel! I currently work as a global patnership ooficer in a logistics firm. I presently want to do more for the company and also enhance my skills. Hereby, bringing me into this world of coding, programming and data science. This is actually a big step for me in my life. Besides my Job, I am a big fan of the UFC and football. Having grown up among football lovers, my love for football is third to none. I hope one day I can become a coach and lead my country to a world cup victory or rather led them to the finals, Nothing less. UFC is one of the major sports I respect so much due the fact fighting takes years of pratices and training. I am a big fan of the brazilian jui jitsu (BJJ) and kickboxing fighting style. Aside football and the UFC I am also a game freak
